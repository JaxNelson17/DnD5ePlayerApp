# DnD5ePlayerApp

This was my final project for Koltin that I did for school.
The app has a super basic character sheet for Dungeons and Dragons. You can put you character name, class, lvl, and the base 6 stats.
You can even roll the dice that you need for DND.
And it has a API call to http://www.dnd5eapi.co fot monsters so you can see their basic stats.
